Delete User
Primary Actor: Admin
Stakeholders and Interests:
• Users of the application – report information is reliable, information is useful and succinct
Precondition:
• User to delete exists
• Admin is logged in
Postcondition:
• User account has been deleted
• Log is updated with the deleted account, admin account that deleted and a timestamp
Happy Path:
1. Admin selects delete user option
2. System displays user ids
3. Admin selects user id to delete
4. System prompts admin for confirmation
5. Admin confirms action
6. System deletes user account and profile
7. System updates log to include userid that was deleted, the admin responsible, and the timestamp
Extensions:
3a. User not found
  i. System reports that user id could not be found and reprompts the admin for action
5b. Admin cancels account delete
  i. System exits to the screen displaying user ids.
Special Requirements:
• Admin accounts cannot be deleted
