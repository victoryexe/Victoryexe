FULLY DRESSED USED CASE
Title: Ban User and Deny them access
Description: Banning a user should mark the user account as permanently unable to authenticate and send 
a message informing the user that they are banned for a specific reason as defined by the admin of the 
system. Banning a user should deny them access at the login screen and therefore prevent them from 
accessing any of their security logs or resources.
Primary Actor: Administrator
Preconditions: Administrator Notices an account or user has committed a form of infraction worth 
suspending their access to our system.
Post conditions: Mentioned user no longer should have access to any of the apps services and does not 
have the ability to log in. The account should be still present in the database, but marked so that it may 
not authenticate. If the user attempts authentication, they should be sent a message that states that they are 
a banned user and the reason for their banishment.
Main Success Scenarios (With Extensions):
1.	Administrator Logs on
2.	Admin searches through the apps database of users
3.	Admin marks that user as banned
a.	If the user is an admin, the ban must go under the approval of another admin
b.	If the user is later found innocent, or the admins recant their descion, any admin should 
be able to remove this status
c.	If the account is deleted, the mark should be deleted with the account and not attach to 
accounts with a similar name and/or password and user name.
4.	When banned, system should prevent user from logging in henceforth and their status should 
show up as such on any logs or reports regarding users
Frequency of Use: Whenever an administrator finds a user that had done something ban worthy
Status: Pending
